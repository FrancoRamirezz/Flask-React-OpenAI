## Hosting
For the personal website: I am going to add it to firebase or vercel to host it

### Client:
Go into terminal and type this "npm install"

Then run "npm start" in the terminal and all the following dependencies will follow

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


## Features 
-  Feature 1: To ensure ports do connect go into
-  "package.json" and use the following code

 "private": true,
"proxy": "http://local-host:5000"

- Feature 2: Implement OpenAI api key. Best practice is to make another file and then import it to the "APP.py"

## Contributing

For the future, the plan is to incorporate a easier usability for the interface and develop more routes for the backend
